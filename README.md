# Auction Experiment #
This is an auction experiment where players are assigned to the role of
buyer or seller. Seller's each posses one object that they can put on sale to
buyers. Each seller in the first round of the experiment set his minimum ask
price for the object. In the second round, buyer's submit bids for each of the
objects. A buyer may purchase at most one object. Each player is paid in one
randomly determined round at the end of the game.
