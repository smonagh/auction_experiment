<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>

<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned $5 for showing up on time.
The instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
If you have questions at any point, raise your hand and an experimenter will
will come and assist you.</p>

<p>You have been assigned the role <b>seller</b> and will be paired randomly with
  a group of other participants. Your identity in this group will remain anonymous
  , and likewise, the identities of all other group members will remain
  anonymous as well. There will be members in your group who are assigned to the
  role of <b>buyer</b> and other members who are assigned to the role of
  <b>seller</b>. All group membership and assigned roles will remain fixed
  during the course of the experiment.

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>
<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
There is a conversion ratio of {{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$. At the
end of the experiment, your earnings in experimental dollars will be converted
and paid out to you in US$. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>In this experiment, you will be assigned an object that will be put up for
sale in an auction. You will be assigned a reservation value for this object. This reservation value
is the minimum price at which you have to sell this object to earn a positive return.
This reservation value will be drawn uniformly from the integer range 1 to 10. This
means that each integer between 1 and 10 is equally likely. Each other buyer and seller
in the group will have their reservations drawn independently from the same distribution.
This means that your own reservation value will not give you any information about
the reservation values of other players. You will retain the same reservation value
for your assigned object in each of the {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds played.

<p> In the first stage, you will set a minimum asking price for your assigned
  object. This is the minimum price that your object will sell for. If a high enough
  bid is not submitted to meet the minimum asking price, then the object will
  not sell. However, if the highest bid submitted for your object does exceed the
  minimum ask price, then the object will be sold to the highest bidder at that
  bid. You will be asked to submit a minimum ask price on a slider as displayed below</p>

  {% formfield player.ask_price with label="Please submit an ask price? " %}

<p>In the second stage, buyers will have an opportunity to bid for your object and
  the objects of other sellers. You will be presented with a table that presents you
  with informaton regarding auction. An example of what you might see is displayed below
</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><center>Object</center> </th>
      <th><center>Minimum Ask</center></th>
      <th><center>Current Bid</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 1</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

</div>

  <p>
    This two stage game will be repeated for a total of {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds. In each round,
    you and all other players will retain the same reservation values for each
    object that you did in the first round. However, sellers may update their
    ask prices and buyers may submit new bids. At the end of each round you will
    be presented with your earnings for the round. At the end of {{Constants.num_rounds}}
    rounds,
    you will recieve your final payout for the experiment which is the sum of
    all your earnings in each of the previous rounds.
  </p>

  <h2> Your Decision </h2>

  <p>
    In the first stage, you will be asked to set a minimum asking price for your
    object. This is the lowest price at which bidders will be able to purchase
    your object from you. You will be asked to set this price between 0 and 10
    E$ on a slider. Once you have set the price that you like, then click on the
    <b>Next</b> button to submit your ask price. After each of the sellers has
    submitted their ask prices, all players will then proceed to the auction
    stage. During the auction stage, you may observe bids that are made for your
    object. When all buyers have indicated that they are finished bidding, the auction
    stage will end.
  </p>

  <h2>Payoff </h2>
  <p>
  After the auction stage, your payout will be calculated and displayed to you.
  If you did not sell an object in the auction stage, then your earnings for
  that round will be 0 E$. However, if you did sell your object,
   then your payoff for the round will be determined
  by the following formula,
 </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Payout = Bid - Reservation Value</b> </p>

 <p> For instance, if your reservation value is 3 E$ and the bid for your object is 7 E$, then
   your payout for that round will be 4 E$.

  <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
  <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
    your earnings in each round that you played, as well as the sum of
    earnings across each of the rounds, and that amount converted into
    US$. Please wait in your seat once you reach this screen. The experimenter
    will call you in one at a time to be paid out privately. Since you will be
    asked to leave when finished, please take all of your belongings up with you
    when you are called</p>
