<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>

<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned $5 for showing up on time.
The instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
If you have questions at any point, raise your hand and an experimenter will
will come and assist you.</p>

<p>You have been assigned the role <b>seller</b> and will be paired randomly with
  a group of other participants. Your identity in this group will remain anonymous
  , and likewise, the identities of all other group members will remain
  anonymous as well. There will be members in your group who are assigned to the
  role of <b>buyer</b> and other members who are assigned to the role of
  <b>seller</b>. All group membership and assigned roles will remain fixed
  during the course of the experiment.

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>
<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
At the end of the experiment, your earnings will be converted at ratio
{{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$ and paid out to you in US$. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>In this experiment you are a seller. Your goal is to sell one widget to a buyer.
   The widget you sell is worth money at the end of the experiment. The total
    amount you earn in this experiment is equal to the total value of the widget
     you sold minus your money value for that widget. </p>

<p> In the first stage of the experiment you and each of the other sellers
   will post their desired price for their widget. This value can be set between
    1 and 40 on a slider.  When setting your desired price, you will
     see the following slider,</p>

  {% formfield player.ask_price with label="Please submit an ask price? " %}

<p>Then, in the second stage, you will try and sell your widget to buyers.
   The buyers with the highest bid will purchase your widget, as long as bid
    submitted by this buyer exceeds the price that you posted. When buyers are
     bidding, you will see a table with information about
      the widgets. An example of what you might see is displayed below.
</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><center>Widget</center> </th>
      <th><center>Minimum Ask</center></th>
      <th><center>Current Bid</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Widget 1</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Widget 2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Widget 3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

</div>

  <p>
    You can exchange the widget you sell to buyers for money at the end of
     the experiment. The widget assigned to you has a randomly determined money
      value of between 1 and 40 E$, and each of these values is equally likely.
       The same widget might have a different value for different buyers. That
        is, your value for a widget is not necessarily the same as the buyer’s
         value for your widget. Likewise, each seller has a different
          money value for their own widget. The value of your widget does not
           factor into your earnings. Therefore, you cannot earn money
            if you do not sell your widget.
  </p>
  <p>Today’s experiment will include N rounds. Your value for your widget will
     always be the same, but you will be able to change your ask, and buyers
      will be able to change their bids, within each new round. At the end of
       each round you will be told your earnings for that round. However, note
        that only one round will be randomly chosen to be
         paid at the end of the experiment.</p>


  <h2> Your Decision </h2>

  <p>
    In the first stage, you will be asked to set a minimum asking price for your object.
     This is the lowest price at which bidders will be able to purchase your
      widget from you. You will be asked to set this price between 1 and 40 E$
       on a slider. Once you have set the price that you like, then click on the
        <b>Next</b> button to submit your ask price. Note the ask price that you set
         must greater than or equal to your value for the widget. If it is not,
          then the ask price for your widget will be reset to the value of the
           widget. After each of the sellers has submitted their ask prices, all
            players will then proceed to the auction stage.
  </p>

  <h2>Payoff </h2>
  <p>
  After the auction stage, your payout will be calculated and displayed to you.
   If you did not sell your widget in the auction stage, then your earnings for
    that round will be 0 E$. However, if you did sell your widget, then your
    payoff for the round will be determined by the following formula,
 </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Payout = Bid - Widget's Value</b> </p>

 <p> For instance, if your money value for your widget is 3 E$ and the bid for your widget is 7 E$, then
   your payout for that round will be 4 E$.

  <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
  <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
     your E$ earnings in each round, the round that was randomly chosen as the
      payoff round, and the earnings from that round converted into US$. Please
      wait in your seat once you reach this screen. An experimenter will call
       you in one at a time to be paid privately. When called, please take all
        your belongings up since the experiment ends once you have received your
         payment.</p>
