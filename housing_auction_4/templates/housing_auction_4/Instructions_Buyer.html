<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned 5 US$ for showing up on time.
 The instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
  so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
   phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
    If you have questions at any point, raise your hand and an experimenter will
     will come to assist you.</p>

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>

<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
 At the end of the experiment, your earnings will be converted at ratio
  {{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$ and paid out to you in US$ in addition
   to the show up fee. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>You will be paired randomly with a group of other participants.
  Your identity in this group will remain anonymous, and likewise,
   the identities of all other group members will remain
    anonymous as well. </p>

<p>In this experiment you are a <b>buyer</b>.

<p>There will be multiple sellers and other buyers in your group. The group will
 remain together and the roles will remain the same during the entire experiment.</p>

<h2> Widgets </h2>

<p>You will have the opportunity to buy one widget from a seller in each round.
  Todayâ€™s experiment will include {{Constants.num_rounds}} identical rounds.</p>

  <p> Each widget has a value to you.
    The same widget may have a different value for its seller and different buyers.
   Each buyer has different values for the widgets. Likewise, each seller has a different
      value for their own widget. The values will remain constant across rounds throughout the experiment.</p>

<h2> Earnings </h2>
The earnings in each round equal to the total value
     of the widget you bought minus your total payment (bid) for buying that
      widget:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Earnings = Widget's Value - Bid</b> </p>

<p> For instance, if your value for a widget was 7 E$ and you bought
   the widget with bid of 3 E$, then your earnings for that round will be 4 E$.
   If you do not buy the widget, your earnings for the round will be 0 E$.
</p>

<p>Note, however, that only one round will be randomly chosen at the end of the experiment to be payed in US$.</p>

<h2> Trading </h2>

{% if subsession.treatment == 'minimum_price' %}

<p>Each round consists of two stages.</p>

<p>In the first stage of each round, each seller will post their desired
   minimum price for their widget for you and the other buyers to see. As a buyer,
   you will not
     actively participate in this stage. After each of the sellers has submitted their minimum price, all
       players will then proceed to the second, trading stage.</p>

     Then, in the second stage, you will try to buy one widget by submitting bids to
     sellers. When bidding, you will see a table with
      information about the widgets:</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><center>Widget</center> </th>
      <th><center>Minimum Price</center></th>
      <th><center>Value</center></th>
      <th><center>Standing Bid</center></th>
      <th><center>Enter Bid</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Widget 1</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Widget 2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Widget 3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
  </table>

</div>

    <p>You can submit <b>integer</b> bids for any of the widgets listed.
 If you have the highest bid for the widget when the round ends,
   and this bid is higher than the minimum price requested by the seller for this
    widget, then you purchase this widget at a price equal to your bid. If you did not have
    the highest bid for any object at the end of the round,
    then you do not buy anything and earn 0 E$.</p>

    <p>If at any time you have the highest bid for a widget,
       this will be noted on the top of your screen.  </p>

  <p>
    You are restricted to purchasing one object per round.
    This means that once you have the highest bid for an object you will not
    be permitted to bid for another object until another buyer in your group
    outbids you for the same object.
  </p>

  <p>There are three important rules for bidding:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Your bid must be higher than the currently highest bid. </li>
    <li> You may not submit a bid that is higher than your value for the widget. </li>
    <li> You may not have the highest bid for more than one object at a time. </li>
  </ol>

 <p> Trading stage ends when there is no active bidding for 50 seconds. You will see an indicator after 20 seconds of inactivity.
   At the end of each round you will be told your earnings for that round. However, remember
    that only one round will be randomly chosen to be
     paid at the end of the experiment.</p>

    {% elif subsession.treatment == 'sellers_bid' %}

    In each round you will try to buy one widget by submitting bids to
     sellers. When bidding, you will see a table with
      information about the widgets:</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><center>Widget</center> </th>
      <th><center>Minimum Price</center></th>
      <th><center>Value</center></th>

      <th><center>Enter Bid</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>5</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">

    </tr>

        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
  </table>

</div>

    <p>You can submit <b>integer</b> bids for any of the widgets listed.
 If you have the highest bid for the widget when the round ends,
   and this bid is higher than the minimum price requested by the seller for this
    widget, then you purchase this widget at a price equal to your bid. If you did not have
    the highest bid for any object at the end of the round,
    then you do not buy anything and earn 0 E$.</p>

    <p>If at any time you have the highest bid for a widget,
       this will be noted on the top of your screen.  </p>

  <p>
    You are restricted to purchasing one object per round.
    This means that once you have the highest bid for an object you will not
    be permitted to bid for another object until another buyer in your group
    outbids you for the same object.
  </p>

    <p>
        The seller of the widget can also make bids for his own widget, but not for the other widgets.
        If the seller wins in the bidding for his own widget, he will not make a transaction and will earn 0 E$.
    </p>

  <p>There are three important rules for bidding:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Your bid must be higher than the currently highest bid. </li>
    <li> You may not submit a bid that is higher than your value for the widget. </li>
    <li> You may not have the highest bid for more than one object at a time. </li>
  </ol>

 <p> Trading stage ends when there is no active bidding for 50 seconds. You will see an indicator after 20 seconds of inactivity.
   At the end of each round you will be told your earnings for that round. However, remember
    that only one round will be randomly chosen to be
     paid at the end of the experiment.</p>

    {% endif %}

 <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
 <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
  your E$ earnings in each round, the round that was randomly chosen as the
   payoff round, and the earnings from that round converted into US$. Please
    wait in your seat once you reach this screen. An experimenter will call
     you in one at a time to be paid privately. When called, please take all
      your belongings up since the experiment ends once you have received your
       payment.</p>
