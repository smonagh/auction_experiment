<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned $5 for showing up on time.
   These instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
    so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
     phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
      If you have questions at any point, please raise your hand and an
       experimenter will come and assist you.</p>

<p>You have been assigned the role <b>buyer</b> and will be paired randomly with
  a group of other participants. Your identity in this group will remain anonymous
  , and likewise, the identities of all other group members will remain
  anonymous as well. There will be members in your group who are assigned to the
  role of <b>buyer</b> and other members who are assigned to the role of
  <b>seller</b>. All group membership and assigned roles will remain fixed
  during the course of the experiment.</p>

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>
<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
There is a conversion ratio of {{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$. At the
end of the experiment, your earnings in experimental dollars will be converted
and paid out to you in US$. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>In this experiment you are a buyer. Your goal is to buy widgets from sellers.
   Each widget you buy is worth money at the end of the experiment.
    The total amount you earn in this experiment is equal to the total value
     of all the widgets you bought minus your total costs for buying the
     widgets.</p>

<p>In the first stage of the experiment each seller will post their desired
   price for their widget. You and the other buyers will see those prices. Then,
    in the second stage, you will try to buy widgets by submitting bids to
    sellers. When bidding, you will see a table that provides you with
    information about the widgets. An example of what you might see
     is displayed below.</p>
<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><center>Object</center> </th>
      <th><center>Minimum Ask</center></th>
      <th><center>Reservation</center></th>
      <th><center>Current Bid</center></th>
      <th><center>Enter Bid</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 1</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
  </table>

</div>
  <p>
    You can exchange the widgets you purchase from sellers for money at the end
     of the experiment. Each widget has a randomly determined money value of
      between 1 and 10 E$, and each of these values is equally likely. The same
       widget might have a different value for different buyers. That is, your
        value for a widget is not necessarily the same as another buyer’s value
         for that same widget.</p>
  <p>
    Today’s experiment will include N rounds.
     Your value for widgets will always be the same, but you will be able to
      change your bids, and sellers will be able to change their asks, within
       each new round. At the end of each round you will be told your earnings
        for that round. Note that your actual earnings at the end of the
         experiment will be randomly selected from one of the rounds played
          during the experiment. So actual money will only be earned in one
           randomly chosen round at the end of the experiment.
  </p>

  <h2> Your Decision </h2>

  <p>
    In the second stage, you can submit bids for any of the widgets listed.
    You can continue to submit bids until all buyers have clicked the button to
     end the round. At that point, if you have the highest bid for the widget,
     and this bid is higher than the price requested by the seller for this
     widget, then you purchase this widget at a price equal to your bid.</p>

  <p>There are three important rules for bidding.</p>

  <ol>
    <li> Your bid must be higher than the currently highest bid. </li>
    <li> You may not submit a bid that is higher than your value for the widget. </li>
    <li> Your total standing bids may not be greater than your endowment. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>If at any time you have the highest bid for a widget,
     this will be noted on the top of your screen, along with how much is left
      from your endowment to spend.  </p>

  <p>You can only purchase a widget if you have the highest bid for that object
     at the end of the round. If you did not have the highest bid for any object
      at the end of the round, then you do not make a transaction in that round.
    </p>

  <h2>Payoff </h2>
  <p>
    At the end of each round, your earnings will be calculated and displayed
     to you. If you did not purchase a widget during a round, then your
      earnings for that round will be 0 E$. If you did have the winning bid for
      one or more widgets at the end of the auction stage, then your payoff for
       the round will be determined by the following formula,
  </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Payout = Widget's Value - Bid</b> </p>

 <p> For instance, if your money value for a widget was 7 E$ and you bought
    the widget with bid of 3 E$, then your earnings for that round will be 4 E$.
 </p>

  <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
  <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
     your E$ earnings in each round, the round that was randomly chosen as the
      payoff round, and the earnings from that round converted into US$.
       Please wait in your seat once you reach this screen. An experimenter will
        call you in one at a time to be paid privately. When called, please
         take all your belongings up since the experiment ends once you have
          received your payment.</p>
