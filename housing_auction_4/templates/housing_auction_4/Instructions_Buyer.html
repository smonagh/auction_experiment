<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned $5 for showing up on time.
The instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
If you have questions at any point, raise your hand and an experimenter will
will come and assist you.</p>

<p>You have been assigned the role <b>buyer</b> and will be paired randomly with
  a group of other participants. Your identity in this group will remain anonymous
  , and likewise, the identities of all other group members will remain
  anonymous as well. There will be members in your group who are assigned to the
  role of <b>buyer</b> and other members who are assigned to the role of
  <b>seller</b>. All group membership and assigned roles will remain fixed
  during the course of the experiment.

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>
<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
There is a conversion ratio of {{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$. At the
end of the experiment, your earnings in experimental dollars will be converted
and paid out to you in US$. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>In this experiment, each seller is assigned an object that they will put up for sale
in an auction. In the first stage, each seller will set a minimum price they
will ask for their object. If the highest bid for the object does not exceed the
minimum asking price, then the object will not be sold. However, if the highest
bid does exceed the minimum asking price, then the object will be sold to the bidder
with the highest bid.</p>

<p>In the second stage, you will have an opportunity to bid for the objects. You
  will be presented with a table that will provide you information about the
  object. An example of what you might see is displayed below.
<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><center>Object</center> </th>
      <th><center>Minimum Ask</center></th>
      <th><center>Reservation</center></th>
      <th><center>Current Bid</center></th>
      <th><center>Enter Bid</center></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 1</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Object 3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td><input type="number" placeholder="Enter Bid">
        <br>
        <input class="btn btn-large btn-primary next-button" type="reset"
        value=" Bid " disabled>
    </tr>
  </table>

</div>
  <p>
    For each object, you will be assigned a reservation value for that object.
    This represents how many experimental dollars you would earn if you were
    able to obtain the ojbect for a bid of 0 E$. These reservation values will
    be drawn uniformly from the integer range 1 to 10. This means that each value,
    1 to 10, is equally likely. Each of the other buyers and sellers will possess
    their own unique reservation values for each of the possible objects that are
    on sale in the auction, and these valuations are independent. This means that
    your specific reservation values will not give you any information about the
    reservation values of other players. </p>
  <p>
    This two stage game will be repeated for a total of {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds. In each round,
    you and all other players will retain the same reservation values for each
    object that you did in the first round. However, sellers may update their
    ask prices and buyers may submit new bids. At the end of each round you will
    be presented with your earnings for the round. At the end of {{Constants.num_rounds}}
    rounds,
    you will recieve your final payout for the experiment which is the sum of
    all your earnings in each of the previous rounds.
  </p>

  <h2> Your Decision </h2>

  <p>
    In the auction stage, you can submit bids for any of the objects listed. This
    period will last until all player have clicked the button to end the round.
    If at the end of the period, you have the highest bid for an object, and this
    bid is higher than the minimum ask price set for this object, then you will
    purchase this object at the price of your bid.

    In order to submit a bid for an object, your bid must be higher than the
    current standing bid. Additionally, you may not submit a bid that is higher
    than your reservation value for the object. If at any time you have the standing
    bid for an object, this will be noted on the top of your screen and you will
    not be able to submit bids for any other objects.
  </p>

  <h2>Payoff </h2>
  <p>
  After the auction stage, your payout will be calculated and displayed to you.
  If you did not purchase an object in the auction stage, then your earnings for
  that round will be 0 E$. However, if you did have the standing bid for an object
  at the end of the auction stage, then your payoff for the round will be determined
  by the following formula,
 </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Payout = Reservation Value - Bid</b> </p>

 <p> For instance, if your reservation value is 7 E$ and your bid is 4 E$, then
   your payout for that round will be 3 E$.

  <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
  <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
    your earnings in each round that you played, as well as the sum of
    earnings across each of the rounds, and that amount converted into
    US$. Please wait in your seat once you reach this screen. The experimenter
    will call you in one at a time to be paid out privately. Since you will be
    asked to leave when finished, please take all of your belongings up with you
    when you are called</p>
