<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned 5 US$ for showing up on time.
 The instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
  so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
   phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
    If you have questions at any point, please, raise your hand and an experimenter
     will come to assist you.</p>

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>

<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
 At the end of the experiment, your earnings will be converted at ratio
  {{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$ and paid out to you in US$ in addition
   to the show up fee. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>You will be paired randomly with a group of other participants.
  Your identity in this group will remain anonymous, and likewise,
   the identities of all other group members will remain
    anonymous. </p>

<p>In this experiment you are a <b>buyer</b>.

    <p>Your group will consist of 3 sellers and 3 buyers. You are one of the three buyers. Your group will
     remain together and the roles will remain the same during the entire experiment.</p>

<h2> Widgets </h2>

<p>In each round you will have the opportunity to buy one widget from a seller.
  Today’s experiment will have {{Constants.num_rounds}} identical rounds.</p>

  <p> Each widget has a value to you. Each seller has one widget for sale.
    Each buyer has different values for the widgets. Likewise, each seller has a different
      value for their own widget. Every buyer and seller will only see their own values for the widgets.
      The values of widgets for buyers and sellers will remain the same across rounds throughout this experiment.</p>

<h2> Trading </h2>

    <p>In each round you will try to buy one widget by negotiating a trade with the
     sellers. At the same time sellers will be negotiating with you and the other buyers.</p>

    <p>You will see a table with
      information about the widgets - the seller of the widget and its value to you.</p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th><center>Seller</center> </th>
          <th><center>Widget</center> </th>
          <th><center>Your Value</center></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seller 1</td>
          <td>Widget 1</td>
          <td>7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seller 2</td>
          <td>Widget 2</td>
          <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Seller 3</td>
          <td>Widget 3</td>
          <td>9</td>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>You will also see a chatbox for each seller and two boxes to enter a message or an offer to the seller:</p>

    <div class='my-chat' id='mychat_1'>
        <div class='otree-chat__messages'>
            <div class="otree-chat__msg_my">
                            <span class='otree-chat__nickname'> Buyer 1 </span>
                            <span class='otree-chat__body'> Example message </span>
            </div>
            <div class="otree-chat__msg_other">
                            <span class='otree-chat__nickname'> Seller 1 </span>
                            <span class='otree-chat__body'> Example message </span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Your Message" class="chatbox" size="40">
        <input type="reset" class="chat_btn btn  btn-large btn-primary next-button" value="Send Message" style="pointer-events:none;">
        <input type="number" placeholder="Enter Your Offer" class="bidbox" id="bidbox_1">
        <!-- Input button returns the widget_id, the current standing bid,
             the ask price for the widget, and the new input bid to
             javascript to verify that the bid clears the previous
             one -->
        <input id='bid_btn_1'
               class="bid_btn btn  btn-large btn-primary next-button"
               type="reset" value="Send Offer" style="pointer-events:none;">
    </div>
    <script>
        $('.bidbox').on('keypress', function (e) {
            if (e.which == 13) {
                e.preventDefault();
            }
        });
        $('.chatbox').on('keypress', function (e) {
            if (e.which == 13) {
                e.preventDefault();
            }
        });
    </script>

    <p></p>

    <p>You can submit text messages and offers to any of the three sellers. Messages can contain any text. Offers must be <b>whole numbers (integer)</b>.</p>

    <p>Buyers' offers have to be at or below the value of the widget to the buyer.
    Sellers' offers have to be at or above the value of the widget to the seller.
    Similarly, a buyer can not accept an offer that is above his value, and the seller can not accept an offer that is below his value.
        This ensures that neither party can lose money.</p>

    <p>Once one side sends an offer, the counterpart can agree or decline. It is also possible to back out of a trade or your own offer at any moment during the round.

        If the other party accepts the trade, <b>the purchase will not happen instantaneously</b>. Both you and the seller can still change your mind and negotiate another deal until the round ends.

        <p>If you and one of the sellers have a standing trade when the round ends,
   then you purchase the widget from the seller at a price equal to the agreed price. If you did not have
    the trade at the end of the round,
    then you do not buy any widget and earn 0 E$. If at any time you have a standing trade,
       this will be indicated at the top of your screen.  </p>

  <p>
    You are restricted to purchasing one widget per round.
    This means that once you have a standing offer or a trade you will not
    be permitted to  make an offer for another widget until you cancel your current offer/trade.
  </p>

 <p> Trading ends after {{timeout_duration}} seconds (A warning message will appear 60 seconds before the end of round).
   At the end of each round you will be told your earnings for that round. Only one round will be randomly chosen to be
     paid at the end of the experiment.</p>


    <h2> Earnings </h2>
The earnings in each round equal the total value
     of the widget you bought minus your total payment (bid) for buying that
      widget:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Earnings = Widget's Value - Bid</b> </p>

<p> For instance, if your value for a widget is 7 E$ and you bought
   the widget with bid of 3 E$, then your earnings for that round will be 4 E$.
   If you do not buy the widget, your earnings for the round will be 0 E$.
</p>

<p>Remember that only one round out of {{Constants.num_rounds}} will be randomly chosen at the end of the experiment, and you will be paid the amount earned in that round in US$.</p>

 <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
 <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
  your E$ earnings in each round, the round that was randomly chosen as the
   payoff round, and the earnings from that round converted into US$. Please
    wait in your seat once you reach this screen. An experimenter will call
     you one at a time to be paid privately. When called, please take all
      belongings up since the experiment ends once you have received your
       payment.</p>

    <h2> Important points to remember </h2>
   <ul>
     <li> You can not lose money by trading (the bidding system prevents you from bidding too high); </li>
     <li> If you do not buy a widget, you earn 0 E$; </li>
       <li> Each seller has one widget to trade per round;</li>
     <li> Each buyer may only buy one widget per round;</li>
     <li> Both buyers and sellers may have different values for the same widget;</li>
       <li> Both buyers and sellers are free to change their minds during the round; </li>
     <li> Only one round will be chosen to be paid in US$; </li>
     <li> Bidding for the round stops after {{timeout_duration}} seconds; </li>
     <li> Today’s experiment will include {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds; </li>
     <li> Values for the widgets will always be the same, but the trading may result in different prices each round.</li>
