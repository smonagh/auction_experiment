<h1> Experiment Instructions </h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
<p>Thank you for participating! You have earned 5 US$ for showing up on time.
 The instructions explain how you can make decisions and earn more money,
  so please read carefully. Talking with other participants or use of cell
   phones is <b>not</b> permitted during the course of this experiment.
    If you have questions at any point, please, raise your hand and an experimenter
     will come to assist you.</p>

<h2> Experimental Points </h2>

<p> During the experiment you have the opportunity to earn experimental dollars (E$).
 At the end of the experiment, your earnings will be converted at ratio
  {{Constants.conversion_rate}} E$ to 1 US$ and paid out to you in US$ in addition
   to the show up fee. </p>

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>You will be paired randomly with a group of other participants.
  Your identity in this group will remain anonymous, and likewise,
   the identities of all other group members will remain
    anonymous. </p>

<p>In this experiment you are a <b>buyer</b>.

    <p>Your group will consist of 3 sellers and 3 buyers. You are one of the three buyers. Your group will
     remain together and the roles will remain the same during the entire experiment.</p>

<h2> Widgets </h2>

    <p>Today’s experiment will have {{Constants.num_rounds}} identical rounds. Each seller will be endowed with one widget in each round of the experiment.
    In each round you will have the opportunity to buy one widget from one of the three sellers for E$. </p>

  <p> Each seller has only one widget for sale.
    Each buyer has different values for the widgets sold. Likewise, each seller has a different
      value for their own widget. Every buyer and seller will only see their own values for the widgets.
      The values of widgets for buyers and sellers will remain the same across rounds throughout this experiment.</p>

<h2> Trading </h2>

    <p>In each round you will try to buy one widget by negotiating a trade with the
     sellers. At the same time, sellers will be negotiating with you and the other buyers.</p>

    <p>You will see a table with
      information about the widgets - the seller of the widget and its value to you.</p>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th><center>Seller</center> </th>
          <th><center>Widget</center> </th>
          <th><center>Your Value</center></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seller 1</td>
          <td>Widget 1</td>
          <td>300</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Seller 2</td>
          <td>Widget 2</td>
          <td>290</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Seller 3</td>
          <td>Widget 3</td>
          <td>280</td>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>You will also see three chatboxes (one for each seller) and two fields below each chatbox to enter a message or an offer to the seller:</p>

    {% for config in player.chat_configs %}
        <h5>{{ config.label }}</h5>
        <div class='my-chat' id='mychat_{{config.channel}}'>
            <div class='otree-chat__messages' style="width:45%">

                </div>
                <div class="otree-chat__msg_other">

            <!-- Input button returns the object_id, the current standing bid,
                 the ask price for the object, and the new input bid to
                 javascript to verify that the bid clears the previous
                 one -->
            <input id='bid_btn_{{forloop.counter}}'
                   class="bid_btn btn  btn-large btn-primary next-button"
                   type="reset" value="Send Offer" style="pointer-events:none;">

        {% include "telephone_market/mychat.html" with nickname=player.chat_nickname channel=config.channel participant_id=1 my_id=player.buyer_id box_id=forloop.counter%}
    <!-- /mychat -->
    {% endfor %}
    <script>
        $('.bidbox').on('keypress', function (e) {
            if (e.which == 13) {
                e.preventDefault();
            }
        });
        $('.chatbox').on('keypress', function (e) {
            if (e.which == 13) {
                e.preventDefault();
            }
        });
    </script>

    <p></p>

    <p>You can submit text messages or offers to trade at a particular price to any of the three sellers. Messages can contain any text. Offers must be <b>whole numbers (integers)</b> and are submitted through the separate "Send Offer" box. Remember to make and accept offers through the offer box, because verbal agreements through messages will not be registered by the trading mechanism. </p>

    <p>All communication is private. For example, messages and offers in the chatbox "Chat with Seller 2" will only be seen by you and seller 2.</p>

    <p>Buyers' offers have to be at or below the value of the widget to the buyer.
    Sellers' offers have to be at or above the value of the widget to the seller.
    Similarly, a buyer can not accept an offer that is above his value, and the seller can not accept an offer that is below his value.
        This ensures that neither party can lose money.</p>

    <p>Once one side sends an offer, the counterpart can agree or decline. It is also possible to back out of a trade or your own offer at any moment during the round.

        If the other party accepts the trade, <b>the purchase will not happen instantaneously</b>. Both you and the seller can still change your mind and negotiate another deal until the round ends.

        <p>If you and one of the sellers have a standing accepted trade when the round ends,
   then you purchase the widget from the seller at a price equal to the agreed price. If you did not have
    the trade at the end of the round,
    then you do not buy any widget and earn 0 E$. If at any time you have a standing trade,
       this will be indicated at the top of your screen.  </p>

  <p>
    You are restricted to purchasing one widget per round.
    This means that once you have a standing offer or a trade you will not
    be permitted to make an offer for another widget until you cancel your current offer/trade by clicking the "Cancel offer/trade" button.
  </p>

    <p> Trading ends after 4 minutes. You will see a timer with the remaining time.</p>
   <p>At the end of each round you will be told your earnings for that round and prices for all traded widgets. Only one round will be randomly chosen to be
     paid at the end of the experiment.</p>


    <h2> Earnings </h2>
The earnings in each round equal the value
     of the widget you bought minus your payment (agreed price) for buying that
      widget:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"> <b>Earnings = Widget's Value - Price</b> </p>

<p> For instance, if your value for a widget is 300 E$ and you bought
   the widget at a price of 200 E$, then your earnings for that round will be 100 E$.
   If you do not buy the widget, your earnings for the round will be 0 E$.
</p>

<p>Remember that only one round out of {{Constants.num_rounds}} will be randomly chosen at the end of the experiment, and you will be paid the amount earned in that round in US$.</p>

 <h2> End of Experiment </h2>
 <p> At the end of the experiment you will be taken to a screen that displays
  your E$ earnings in each round, the round that was randomly chosen as the
   payoff round, and the earnings from that round converted into US$. Please
    wait in your seat once you reach this screen. An experimenter will call
     you one at a time to be paid privately. When called, please take all
      belongings up since the experiment ends once you have received your
       payment.</p>

    <h2> Important points to remember </h2>
   <ul>
     <li> You can not lose money by trading (the trading system prevents you from making or accepting an offer that is too high); </li>
     <li> If you do not buy a widget, you earn 0 E$; </li>
       <li> Each seller has one widget to trade per round;</li>
     <li> Each buyer may only buy one widget per round;</li>
     <li> Both buyers and sellers may have different values for the same widget;</li>
       <li> Both buyers and sellers are free to change their minds during the round; </li>
     <li> Only one round will be chosen to be paid in US$; </li>
     <li> Trading for the round stops after 4 minutes; </li>
     <li> Today’s experiment will include {{Constants.num_rounds}} rounds; </li>
     <li> Values for the widgets will always be the same, but the trading may result in different prices each round.</li>
